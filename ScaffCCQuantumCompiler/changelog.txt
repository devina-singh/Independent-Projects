2018-06-28:
    Release version -v4.0
    Added Rx and Ry gates
    Standardized order of CNOT&Toffoli's arguments to control(s) followed by target
    Changed default compilation settings so that rotation and Toffoli decomposition are off by default
    Fixed logical bugs in Ising Model benchmark
2018-02-06:
    Release version -v3.1
    Added ability to output OpenQASM (via -b flag for scaffold.sh).
    Released Braidflash v2.0, with improved simulation of magic state distillation overheads,
    including different distillation protocols and different factory layouts.
    Fixed bug in braidflash generating machine-dependent results due to uninitialized variable.
    Fixed "file not found" bug in some scripts.
2017-08-06:
	Release version -v3.0-alpha
	New software package, Braidflash, added - in braidflash/ directory (Unix only)
	New software package, Rotation Generator, added for future support in dynamic rotation generation - in scripts/gen_rotations/ directory
	New software package, RKQCVerifier, added in scripts/RKQCVerifier/ directory
	Fixed bugs in the QASM flattening tool chain
	Added new compilation flag for QASM circuit optimization (Unix only) - “-o”
	Fixed minor bugs in the SHA-1 algorithm
	Changes made to gen-lpfs.sh to enable support for braidflash
	Changes made to installation regression tests to catch flattening bugs
2016-10-01:
	Release version -v2.0
	Added OSX Build - available on ScaffCC_OSX branch
	New data type abit added - representation of ancilla bits
	New function afree() added - usage: free ancilla bits and conserve usage
	throughout algorithms
	New function reverse() added - usage: reverse the computational steps of a
	specific function in an automated fashion
	New implementation of RKQC added - subcompiler call now directly inlined
	in an LLVM module pass
	Several small notational changes made to algorithms Boolean Formula, Class Number,
	RKQC_Test, and SHA-1
	New compilation flag to generate QX quantum computer simulator input files added - "-s",
	now algorithms can be compiled down to acceptably formatted input files
	for the QX quantum computer simulator available from TU Delft
2016-08-20:
	Release version - v1.0-beta.2
	Updates made to Class Number algorithm, corrections to QASM section
	Changes made to gen-lpfs.sh and gen-scheds.sh to allow for integration of coarse-grained scheduling with full schedule outputs of LPFS
	Changes made to GenLPFSSchedule.cpp to prepend metrics header to all LPFS scheduled functions for integration with CG scheduling
