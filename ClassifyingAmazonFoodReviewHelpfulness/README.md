## Project Setup

Download `reviews.csv` from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews) and place it at `./data/reviews.csv`.

Also download 300-dim GloVe vectors and place them at `./glove.6B.300d.txt`.

Running most of the code is self explanatory. To train the LSTM, run LSTM_train.py. Modify constants in LSTM_constants, or edit the model itself in LSTM_model.
